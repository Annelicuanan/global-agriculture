            Crop production is a branch of agriculture, which includes the cultivation of crops in field cultivation,
            vegetable
            growing, fruit growing, etc. This industry gives necessary food. Consumer goods manufacturing and food
            industries gets
            raw materials.

            <li>The entire world depends on agriculture for its food.</li>
            <li>The soil should be loosened and aerated properly during crop production.</li>

            <li>The crops should be irrigated periodically.

            Livestock, farm animals, with the exception of poultry. In Western countries the category encompasses
            primarily cattle,
            sheep, pigs, goats, horses, donkeys, and mules; other animals, such as buffalo, oxen, llamas, or camels, may
            predominate
            in the agriculture of other areas.

            <li>Micro-livestock is the term used for much-smaller animals, usually mammals.</li>
            <li>Farming practices. Traditionally, animal husbandry was part of the subsistence farmer's way of life,
                producing not only the food needed by
                the family but also the fuel, fertiliser, clothing, transport and draught power. Killing the animal for
                food was a
                secondary consideration, and wherever possible their products, such as wool, eggs, milk and blood (by
                the Maasai) were
                harvested while the animal was still alive</li>
            <li>Predation. Livestock farmers have often dealt with natural world animals' predation and theft by
                rustlers. In North America,

                livestock.</li>

            Overview
        </h3>
        <p>
            The word sustainable has become very popular in recent years, and it is now used to describe a lot of
            things. But what
            is sustainable agriculture? Simply put, sustainable agriculture is the production of plant and animal
            products,
            including food, in a way that uses farming techniques that protect the environment, public health,
            communities, and the
            welfare of animals.

            Sustainable agriculture allows us to produce and enjoy healthy foods without compromising the ability of
            future
            generations to do the same. The key to sustainable agriculture is finding the right balance between the need
            for food
            production and the preservation of environmental ecosystems.

        <h3>
            Key Points
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Crop rotation is one of the most powerful techniques of sustainable agriculture. Its purpose is to avoid
                the
                consequences that come with planting the same crops in the same soil for years in a row.</li>
            <li>Permaculture is a food production system with intention, design, and smart farming to reduce waste of
                resources and
                create increased production efficiency.</li>
            <li>Cover Crops
                Many farmers choose to have crops planted in a field at all times and never leave it barren; this can
                cause unintended
                consequences.</li>
            <li>Soil is a central component of agricultural ecosystems. Healthy soil is full of life, which can often be
                killed by the
                overuse of pesticides.</li>
            <li>In order to maintain effective control over pests, it is important to view the farm as an ecosystem as
                opposed to a
                factory.</li>
